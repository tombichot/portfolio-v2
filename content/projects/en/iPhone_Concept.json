  "Description": "3D modeling of an iPhone 12 concept made with Blender. \n\n While many supposed renderings of the iPhone 12 appear on the Internet and being full discovery of Blender in a UV on image synthesis, I wondered if I was able to do the same thing. After about thirty hours of work here is the result.  \n\n Modeling is quite simple in itself, it's the taking into account of the detail that takes a lot of time. The realization of realistic lenses for the cameras was the most tedious. At first, I started with 3 lenses as in reality, but in the end, a single lens with a more elaborate shader was much better and simpler in my case. \n\n I was able to reuse this personal project in the modeling project of a dining room",
