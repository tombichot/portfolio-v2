  "Description": "Development of a mini social network in the form of an iOS application in Swift. \n\n This is my oldest project (if we forget the small flashlight application developed for BadaOS). I started working on it when I was in high school. The idea was to make a social network based on position like the Happn application (which didn't exist yet at the time) offers. The application was called Proxymity and it was at first only models on paper and then made with Photoshop. With the arrival of the Swift language on iOS, I started the development by changing a little the basic idea and the name which became Near. All the backend part was managed with Parse. The application already had a few features, the main one being to leave a message with a picture on a map at precise coordinates. This message was then visible to other users. \n\n Parse then became open-source, I continued to use it for a while. Following the release of a new major version of Swift (Swift 3.0?), I decided to reboot the project, this time using Firebase for the backend. I also completely redesigned the application. \n\n It's a project that I unfortunately never finished due to lack of time, but also by choice, the controversies notably around the respect of privacy that started to be born around Facebook made me think a lot. It remains nevertheless a beautiful project, because it is with this one that I really discovered the code and the creation of visuals. It was all the more formative as I always looked for solutions by myself. It was a good complement to my training and to all the other group projects I was able to do afterwards",
