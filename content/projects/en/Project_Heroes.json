  "Description": "Prototype of a survival game based on the zombie mode of Call Of Duty, but much more fun! After working a lot with Unity3D, I decided to use it for a little game I've been thinking about for some time: a game based on the zombie mode of Call Of Duty. So I started working on a prototype for mobile. \n\n After making this very simple prototype, I think I'm going to develop my idea not for mobile but rather for PC where I'll feel less cramped. I will also use the Unreal Engine instead of Unity. This will allow me to get up to speed with this engine and to redo a little C++ after a lot of C#. \n\n Future to follow! \n\n Link to a small demo : <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4L6oAnWarZo\">https://youtu.be/4L6oAnWarZo</a>",
