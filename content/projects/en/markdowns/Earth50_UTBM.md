Survival game in VR developed with Unity, a student project developed in pairs with Maxime LUCAS.

The game immerses the player in an alternative medieval world after a teleportation. This is where the name Earth50 comes from, in the manner of comic books and their alternative Earths. Unfortunately for him, the player has been followed by a horde of robots and must survive while they await To do so, he will use the weapons at their disposal, namely 2 pistols and a magic axe. I promise we will give it back to Kratos...

This project allowed us to become familiar with VR development and its specificities such as the management of hands to interact with what surrounds us. It's a very complete project because it's totally playable and has a small scenario, animations (Mixamo), sounds as well as visual effects.
