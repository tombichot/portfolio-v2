Modeling a dining room with Blender. 
<br>
<br>
This project was carried out within a UV on image synthesis. I had to model different elements such as cutlery, plates, glasses and to stage them very simply. The video maker BlenderGuru (YouTube) inspired me a lot with his turoriels, so I pushed a little more the scope of the subject by creating a photorealistic dining room.

I started from a photo found on Google Image and tried to recreate the scene on Blender by adding some personal touches. I started by making a table and then the chairs (redone a second time later), always from a photo. I then created the room itself and the different pieces of furniture.

As I went along, I went into details, from modeling the glasses in the furniture to the candles, following tutorials for certain materials. On the table, we also find the iPhone concept presented in my portfolio. Finally, I used an HDRi image for the background and global lighting. The only things I didn't model in this scene are the different plants.
