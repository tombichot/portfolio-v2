Minesweeper game in Java, student project developed with 6 other students during my Associateâ€™s Degree.

<br>
This is the first big project developed during my DUT. We were indeed 7 students on this project which was tutored. I was the leader of this project. I was also in charge of the design of the game and the development of some features.

It's a classic version of the deminer with 3 levels of difficulty, sounds and score management. What I remember most is the management of the project which was a small challenge at the time since we were 7 students. It is important to be precise in the distribution of tasks and rigorous in their follow-up so as not to lose track and be efficient in this kind of case. From this point of view, it was a very rewarding project.
